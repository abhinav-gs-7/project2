# 🎓 Student Management System (Java)

### 📘 Overview
The **Student Management System (SMS)** is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to manage student records efficiently.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, and **Data Handling** using Java Collections (`ArrayList`).

### 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Encapsulation** | The `student` class has private fields with controlled access via getter methods |
| **Abstraction** | Complex operations like search and delete are hidden inside menu options |
| **ArrayList** | Dynamically stores student objects with easy addition and removal |
🔮 Future Enhancements

Add multiple classes (e.g., Teacher, Department)

Store data permanently using file handling or database

Create GUI using Swing or JavaFX
